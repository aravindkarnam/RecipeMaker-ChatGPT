The challenger sometimes tricks you by giving random words for the name of recipe.
When that happens you have to return a JSON payload indicating errors.

For example if challenge is "Batman in USA"

{
  "errors":[
  {
    "name":"recipe",
    "input": "Batman",
    "message": "Batman is an invalid recipe"
  }]
}

Here's the challenge given to you by the challenger <>"${recipe} in ${currency}<>"
